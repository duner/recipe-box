This is my Grandma Faith's recipe for hamantaschen. It yields 48 hamantaschen (but you can cut the dough recipe in half to make 24). Here is the recipe in her own handwriting, which is transcribed below.

### Dough
#### Ingredients
* Flour, sifted (3 cups)
* Baking powder (2 teaspoons)
* Salt (1/4 cup)
* Sugar, sifted (1 cup)
* Crisco (1 cup)
* Eggs (2)
* Orange juice (1/4 cups)

#### Instructions
Sift the dry ingredients together. Add crisco and cut into mixture with pastry blender. Add eggs and orange juice. Stir, then knead the dough gently. Form a ball and wrap the dough in saran wrap. Chill for 1 hour. Put flour on the counter, divide the dough into 3 parts, roll out, adding more flour if dough gets too sticky. Using a 3 inch glass, cut out circles. Peel away excess dough (You will form a ball and roll out again). Place 1 teaspoon filling on each circle. Pinch to form hamantaschen.  Place on cookie tray. Bake at 350ยบ for 20-30 minutes until golden brown. Watch them.

### Filling
Use Apricot or Prune Solo canned filling or make your own. You can be creative here with chocolate chips, Nutella, jams, or anything else you like.

#### Apricot
* Dried apricots (1 cup)
* Orange juice (1/4 cup)

Cook over low heat for 10 minutes until soft. Puree to a soft paste.

#### Prune
* Pitted prunes (1 cup)
* Sugar (1 tablespoon)
* Water (1/4 cup)

Cook together for 10 minutes, or until soft. Puree to a smooth paste.
